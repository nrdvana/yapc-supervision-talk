Simplifying Perl Daemons
using Supervisors


This talk discusses the de-facto standard for "daemonizing" a process
in Unix, and why the de-facto standard is WRONG.

It shows how much work is involved in doing this, and then shows
how you can avoid all that work by using a supervisor.

It then lists some good supervisor tools, and suggestes reading
about them on their individual sites.
